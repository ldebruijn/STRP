STRP Project back-end
=======

This repository holds the back-end for the FHICT Delta STRP project 2015. The logic for the clustering of entities and the behaviour of the entities and clusters is part of the back-end.

Requirements
------------

To run this project, the following software and libraries are required:
* Python 3.x
* Scikit Learn 0.15
* Numpy 1.9.1
* MatPlotLib 1.4.3


ToDo
----

* Wait for the input group to determine what their input to us will look like
* Transform input to a format which yields the best results for our algorithm
* Temper with the input data every now and then to simulate a living ecosystem
* Have a buffer of algorithms where each buffer item represents a state in the ecosystem. This buffer will be used to allow the front-end to simulate movement for entities between two states.
* Output the results of our algorithm somewhere.
